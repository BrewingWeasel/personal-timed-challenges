# Challenge 1: wordscramble
The first thing I tried to do was to make a wordscramble game in Rust in an hour. 
I finished on time, but I ended up spending an extra ~5 minutes in order to fix a bug with the leaderboard.
Due to the pressure of the time limit, I wrote extremely hacky and sloppy code, but it did end up working.
I think if I had done this in a language that I had used more recently or knew a bit better, I could have finished much faster because I had to figure out how to do stuff like shuffling a list and so on.
